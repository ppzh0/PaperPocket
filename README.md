## How was this developed?
This project heavily relies on artificial intelligence (AI), specifically [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/overview/) developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com). There were significant changes made into the development after the first draft. The site now uses Bootstrap for consistent performance across all platforms though it still retains the footnote:
> *Made with ChatGPT in a rush!*
## What about the contents?
The contents in this project were carefully collected from Facebook pages, groups and from actual physical copies of the exam papers and modified to fit into A4 standards. The papers has been edited for the sole purpose of distributing only the questions and exam formats.
## What is the purpose?
Our main goal is to make studies more fast and accessible to every students in Myanmar and to reduce academic cost. We also aim to make a record of the exams held in Myanmar.

## About PaperPocket  

### Initialization  

PaperPocket launched its service on March 1, 2024. PaperPocket operates as an non-profit organization though there aren't many people working on the project yet. This project is independent from monetary gain.  

### Development Process  

PaperPocket was developed with the help of OpenAI's service: ChatGPT. Later in the development process, it was decided that the user interface (UI) have to be redone.  

Now, some parts of the Javascript code are generated with DeepSeek AI.  

More efficient codes and less human labour inclusive development process will be integrated into the project in the near future.

### Contents  

PaperPocket offers valuable documents for students who have to study under certain conditions: mostly online and for those where study materials are out of stock.

We have been gathering past exam papers from Facebook groups, online forums. Some of the papers are collected directly from physical copies.  

As the Myanmar educational communities have not been active in this kind of activities (i.e., sharing exam papers), we have been unable to collect most of the past exam papers (2023-2025).

#### Content Copyright

Since we (PaperPocket) have spent so much time refining and retouching the photos and images of exam papers, we do not want someone to just print them out and "sell" it for profit or monetary gain. PaperPocket encourage using the materials provided as "you" like.  

However, the notice must be given to all the users of PaperPocket such that using the service for self-profiting is strictly prohibited. PaperPocket carries out the duties as an non-profit organization.

By visiting or using PaperPocket's services (i.e., accessing the website, and/or downloading papers), you are agreed to follow the terms of service as stated in the terms of service page on PaperPocket website(s).
